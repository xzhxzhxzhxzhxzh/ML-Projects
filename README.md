# ML-Projects
Personal projects on some typical datasets (e. g. CIFAR10, MNIST ect.) with PyTorch. The propose of these projects is to construct a complete pipeline from data preparation, to model training, then to performance visualization. Different models and different optimization strategies are also to be evaluated. 

## Datasets
### CIFAR10
The [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) are labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 coloured images in 10 classes, where each image has a dimension of 32x32. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The validation set is taken from training set with probability 20%.

### MNIST
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that are labeled by true digits they represent. Each handwritten digit is shown on a grayscale picture 

The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 coloured images in 10 classes, where each image has a dimension of 32x32. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The validation set is taken from training set with probability 20%.

Task 3: Oil Painting
This is not a real picture but an oil painting, nevertheless, my program has successfully reconstructed its 3D space with some foreground objects. You can just take a look at the result via oil-painting.fig because it is a reletive simple image.

Task 4: Simple Room
This is also an oil painting. You can take a look at the result via simple-room.fig.

Owing to time constraints, I will give the other details later.
