# ML-Projects
Personal projects on some typical datasets (e. g. CIFAR10, MNIST ect.) with PyTorch. The propose of these projects is to construct a complete pipeline from data preparation, to model training, then to performance visualization. Different models and different optimization strategies are also to be evaluated. 

## Datasets

### CIFAR10

### MNIST

## File Architecture

## Result evaluation

Task 3: Oil Painting
This is not a real picture but an oil painting, nevertheless, my program has successfully reconstructed its 3D space with some foreground objects. You can just take a look at the result via oil-painting.fig because it is a reletive simple image.

Task 4: Simple Room
This is also an oil painting. You can take a look at the result via simple-room.fig.

Owing to time constraints, I will give the other details later.
